        <h2>Q: Why should I pursue data standardization with NWB?</h2>
        <p>A: One big limitation of existing automatic approaches for segmentation, identification, and quantification is that they are 
          often only trained and tested on data acquired by one lab under a very specific set of imaging conditions. This can limit the 
          generalizability of these approaches. Different labs have vastly different protocols for storing data which makes the task of 
          merging diverse datasets into a single pipeline or analysis approach quite burdensome. We believe that standardizing data storage
          approaches to a common file format and archive will make this process much simpler, enabling new collaborations and speeding up 
          the production of new tools and algorithms.

        <h2>Q: How much does it cost to store data on DANDI?</h2>
        <p>A: DANDI storage is completely free! Even datasets that are terabytes large can be uploaded and stored for free on DANDI.
           DANDI is NIH-funded for at least the next 6 years and expects to be able to maintain this level of free storage long-term.
