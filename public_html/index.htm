        A comprehensive resource for the <i>C. elegans</i> neuroscience community to facilitate data standardization, storage, and sharing as well
        as provide tools for data conversion and pipelines for analysis of <i>C. elegans</i> whole-brain imaging.

            We aim to simplify the process of developing new approaches for labeling <i>C. elegans</i> neurons in volumetric images by
            providing a resource for tools and code for facilitating neuron ID and related data analysis tasks as well as a consolidated database 
            of various imaging datasets from labs around the world. We hope these resources will expedite the development of new algorithms for automatic identification of <i>C. elegans</i> 
            neurons and enable new discoveries.
            <br><br>
            We provide links to existing databases of labeled NeuroPAL images and GCaMP time series stored in the <a href=https://www.nwb.org>Neurodata without borders</a> (NWB) format
            on the <a href=https://dandiarchive.org>DANDI Archive</a> as well as code for pre-processing, neuron segmentation, curation, and identification of novel 
            NeuroPAL images.

            We introduce a novel extension to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) HDF5-based file format to support data associated with volumetric calcium
            imaging in <i>C. elegans</i>. We believe NWB will be an extremeley useful tool for the worm neuroscience community to standardize file formats and
            data storage solutions in order to facilitate data sharing and collaborations.
            <br><br>
            The data page contains links to datasets stored on the DANDI archive and information about how to download and use NWB files stored on the DANDI archive. 
            <br><br>
            See our page on adding your own dataset to learn how to convert your own data to NWB, upload it to DANDI, and add it here to contribute to this community resource.

            The code page contains descriptions and links to relevant code for reading, processing, and analyzing NeuroPAL images and GCaMP time series.
            <br><br>
            We provide a few example pipelines for segmentation, curation, and quantification of neurons from raw data. This page will be updated 
            as these pipelines continue to develop.
            <br><br>
            We hope to establish a community framework for <i>C. elegans</i> whole-brain imaging analysis pipelines that carries data through the whole process
            starting from raw NeuroPAL structural images and calcium imaging data to segmented neuron locations, cell identity labels, and quantified calcium activity
            for each cell.

            The 'add your data' page contains comprehensive tools and information for converting your own calcium imaging data into the NWB format, uploading the data to DANDI,
            and adding it here to contribute to this community resource. 
            <br><br>
            We hope to continue to grow this resource of existing datasets to facilitate new research and the development of new tools by providing datasets to be used
            for training and testing of both new and existing approaches.
